*DESCRIPTION*: This project demonstrates a simple AI-based recommendation system built in Java using the Apache Mahout library. The system uses collaborative filtering to recommend products or content based on user preferences and historical ratings. It loads sample user-item preference data, builds a model, computes user similarities, and generates recommendations for a target user. This practical example helps you understand how to integrate machine learning libraries like Mahout into Java applications to deliver personalized recommendations, which are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and content platforms.
